# AI/MOSA Content Expansion Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan addresses the two **HIGH PRIORITY** gaps identified in the DoD IP Learning Resources analysis:
- **AI/Emerging Tech**: Only 3 resources (target: 10+)
- **MOSA (Modular Open Systems Approach)**: Only 4 resources (target: 10+)

## Current State

### AI/Emerging Tech (3 resources)
| Audience | Coverage |
|----------|----------|
| Program Managers | 3 |
| Contracting Officers | 3 |
| Engineers | 0 |
| Legal/IP Attorneys | 2 |
| Small Business | 0 |
| Logisticians | 0 |
| Acquisition Workforce | 2 |

**Critical Gaps**: Engineers, Small Business, Logisticians have ZERO AI/IP coverage.

### MOSA (4 resources)
| Audience | Coverage |
|----------|----------|
| Program Managers | 3 |
| Contracting Officers | 3 |
| Engineers | 3 |
| Legal/IP Attorneys | 3 |
| Small Business | 0 |
| Logisticians | 2 |
| Acquisition Workforce | 1 |

**Critical Gap**: Small Business has ZERO MOSA coverage.

## Implementation Timeline

### Immediate Actions (Week 1-2)
1. Identify existing DoD/DAU content that can be tagged/categorized as AI or MOSA
2. Review pending DAU course updates for AI/MOSA content
3. Compile list of external resources (NIST, USPTO) for curation

### Short-Term Development (Month 1-2)
1. Develop 2-3 foundational documents for each topic area
2. Script and record 1 video per topic area
3. Schedule webinar series (monthly)

### Medium-Term Development (Month 3-6)
1. Complete remaining resources
2. Develop interactive case studies
3. Create assessment/quiz modules
4. Update metadata and publish

---

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Timeline |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| AI/Emerging Tech Resources | 3 | 10+ | 6 months |
| MOSA Resources | 4 | 10+ | 6 months |
| Engineer AI Coverage | 0 | 5+ | 3 months |
| Small Business MOSA Coverage | 0 | 3+ | 3 months |
| Overall Quality Score | 70 | 80+ | 6 months |

---

## Resource Requirements

### Content Development
- Subject Matter Experts (AI, MOSA, IP Law)
- Instructional Designer
- Video Production Capability
- Technical Writers

### Review & Approval
- OGC/Legal review for IP accuracy
- OSBP stakeholder review
- DAU curriculum alignment check

---

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Rapidly evolving AI landscape | Quarterly content review cycle |
| SME availability | Leverage DAU and service SME networks |
| Technology classification concerns | Focus on unclassified policy/strategy content |
| Budget constraints | Prioritize document/webinar formats (lower cost) |

---

## Next Steps

1. **OSBP Coordination**: Present gap analysis to stakeholders
2. **DAU Partnership**: Align with existing course development cycles
3. **SME Identification**: Build expert roster for content review
4. **Content Calendar**: Establish quarterly development milestones
5. **Dashboard Integration**: Update data_analysis.json as new resources added
